Progress log 1

  WHAT IS ADDED: 
  - Added a JSON parser library, used for configurations.json at the moment
    - restaurantsToList(rawStr: String) => Restaurant[]
    - NO TESTS YET
  - Added an abstract class Restaurant and subclasses FazerRestaurant and SodexoRestaurant
    - getURL
      - gets the location of menu json on the internet
    - NO TESTS YET
  - The program is currently able to process commands inserted as arguments when it's ran
    - handleArgs -> actions -> handleAction(action)
    - NO TESTS YET

  POSSIBLE ERRORS:
  - Haven't bumped up into any severe problems

  WORKLOAD:
  - 6-8 hours maybe? not 100% efficently but still

  PROGRESS:
  - I think everything is about as progressed as I predicted
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Progress log 2

WHAT IS ADDED:
  - Parsing Sodexo and Fazer menu JSONs and making menu objects from them
  - Renamed classes like Moment -> DateTools, Json -> JsonTools
  - Added class Menu and case classes Food & Component
  - You can now get a commandline overview of restaurant menus
  - Fetching JSONS is now concurrent by using scala futures 
    --> much faster loading times
  
  - No tests for added functionality still sadly

  POSSIBLE ERRORS:
    - No errors as of yet.

  WORKLOAD:
    - My rough estimate is 15 hours, however not 100% efficent. Been doing the project passively while doing other stuff

  PROGRESS:
    - Maybe a little ahead or on schedule as only remains documentation, tests, GUI and some of the other functionality like filtering restaurants etc
